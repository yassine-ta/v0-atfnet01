### Key Strategy Elements

#### Dual-Domain Analysis

OPT_ATFNet analyzes price data in both time and frequency domains:

- **Time Domain**: Traditional technical analysis focusing on price levels, trends, patterns, and momentum
- **Frequency Domain**: Spectral analysis using FFT to identify dominant cycles, periodicities, and hidden patterns

The system dynamically adjusts the weighting between these domains based on their predictive performance in current market conditions.

#### Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism is a key innovation that allows the system to focus on the most relevant market factors. It works by:

1. Assigning weights to different market factors (price, ATR, Z-Score, trend strength, etc.)
2. Calculating a weighted score based on current market conditions
3. Learning from trade outcomes to adjust weights over time
4. Normalizing weights to maintain balanced decision-making

This approach allows the system to adapt to changing market conditions and focus on the factors that are most predictive in the current environment.

#### Adaptive Forecasting

OPT_ATFNet uses multiple forecasting methods and combines them adaptively:

1. **Time-Domain Forecasting**: Uses regression and statistical methods to predict future prices
2. **Frequency-Domain Forecasting**: Uses FFT to identify cycles and project them forward
3. **RNN-Based Forecasting**: Uses a simple recurrent neural network for sequence prediction

These forecasts are combined using an adaptive weighting mechanism that adjusts based on the recent accuracy of each method.

## Signal Generation

The signal generation process in OPT_ATFNet involves several steps:

### 1. Feature Extraction

The system extracts a comprehensive set of features from market data:

- **Price-based features**: Current price, recent highs/lows, range position
- **Volatility features**: ATR, Z-Score, price velocity
- **Trend features**: EMA trend strength, directional movement
- **Pattern features**: Candlestick patterns, chart formations
- **Frequency features**: Spectral entropy, dominant frequencies, cyclicality

### 2. Attention Scoring

The attention mechanism calculates a weighted score based on current feature values:

\`\`\`
attentionScore = Î£(featureValue_i * featureWeight_i)
\`\`\`

Where:
- `featureValue_i` is the normalized value of feature i
- `featureWeight_i` is the learned weight for feature i

### 3. Price Forecasting

The system generates price forecasts using multiple methods:

- **Time-domain forecast**: Uses linear regression and statistical methods
- **Frequency-domain forecast**: Projects dominant cycles forward
- **RNN forecast**: Uses a simple recurrent neural network

These forecasts are combined using adaptive weights:

\`\`\`
combinedForecast = (timeWeight * timeForecast) + (freqWeight * freqForecast) + (rnnWeight * rnnForecast)
\`\`\`

### 4. Signal Aggregation

The signal aggregator combines attention scores and forecasts to generate trading signals:

\`\`\`
entrySignal = (attentionWeight * attentionScore) + (forecastWeight * forecastStrength) + (filterWeight * filterScore)
\`\`\`

A trade is triggered when:
1. The entry signal exceeds the threshold
2. The trend filter conditions are met (if enabled)
3. The frequency filter allows trading in current conditions
4. Risk management conditions are satisfied

## Risk Management

OPT_ATFNet implements a sophisticated risk management system that operates at multiple levels:

### Position Sizing

Position size is calculated based on:

1. **Risk per trade**: The percentage of account balance risked on each trade
2. **Stop loss distance**: The distance from entry to stop loss in price units
3. **Account conditions**: Current drawdown, recent performance, etc.

The formula used is:

\`\`\`
positionSize = (accountBalance * riskPercentage) / (entryPrice - stopLossPrice)
\`\`\`

This is then adjusted based on:
- Current drawdown (reduced size when in drawdown)
- Recent performance (increased size after consistent profits)
- Market volatility (reduced size in highly volatile conditions)

### Dynamic Risk Adjustment

The system dynamically adjusts risk parameters based on:

1. **Account growth**: Gradually increases risk as the account grows
2. **Drawdown protection**: Reduces risk during drawdown periods
3. **Consecutive losses**: Reduces risk after multiple consecutive losses
4. **Market regime**: Adjusts risk based on current market conditions

### Multi-Level Protection

OPT_ATFNet implements multiple layers of protection:

1. **Position-level protection**: Stop loss for each individual trade
2. **Strategy-level protection**: Maximum positions, correlation filters
3. **Account-level protection**: Maximum daily loss, maximum drawdown
4. **Emergency protection**: Automatic trading pause after severe drawdown

### Trailing Stop Strategy

The system uses a sophisticated trailing stop strategy:

1. **Initial stop loss**: Based on ATR or key market levels
2. **First target**: Partial position close at first R:R target
3. **Breakeven move**: Stop loss moved to breakeven after first target
4. **Trailing activation**: Trailing stop activated after swing target
5. **ATR-based trailing**: Trail distance based on ATR multiple

## Market Regime Detection

OPT_ATFNet can detect different market regimes and adapt its strategy accordingly:

### Regime Classification

The system classifies market conditions into four main regimes:

1. **Trending**: Strong directional movement with good R-squared fit
2. **Ranging**: Oscillating price within defined boundaries
3. **Volatile**: Large price movements with high standard deviation
4. **Choppy**: Erratic price movement with frequent direction changes

### Detection Metrics

Market regimes are detected using several metrics:

1. **Trend strength**: R-squared of linear regression on recent prices
2. **Volatility**: Standard deviation of recent price returns
3. **Cyclicality**: Frequency of direction changes in recent price movement

### Strategy Adaptation

For each market regime, the system adapts its parameters:

1. **Trending markets**:
   - Increase trend-following weight
   - Reduce mean-reversion weight
   - Extend position holding time

2. **Ranging markets**:
   - Increase mean-reversion weight
   - Reduce trend-following weight
   - Shorten position holding time

3. **Volatile markets**:
   - Widen stop losses
   - Reduce position sizes
   - Increase profit targets

4. **Choppy markets**:
   - Increase signal thresholds
   - Reduce overall exposure
   - Consider pausing trading

## Performance Analytics

OPT_ATFNet includes comprehensive performance tracking and analysis:

### Trade Metrics

The system tracks key performance metrics:

1. **Win rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
2. **Profit factor**: Ratio of gross profit to gross loss
3. **Average win/loss**: Average profit of winning trades vs. losing trades
4. **Maximum drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
5. **Sharpe ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measure

### Component Effectiveness

The system also tracks the effectiveness of individual components:

1. **Attention accuracy**: How often the attention mechanism correctly identifies profitable setups
2. **Forecast accuracy**: How accurately the price forecaster predicts future price movements
3. **Filter effectiveness**: How effectively the frequency filter eliminates poor trades

### Performance Reporting
